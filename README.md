# basha-portfolio
I'm creating a personal portfolio website for my friend Basha to showcase his skills, projects, and achievements. The website is built using Next.js, styled for a clean and modern look, and hosted on Vercel for seamless deployment. The goal is to provide Basha with a professional online presence, making it easy for potential employers.
